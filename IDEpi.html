<h2>Infectious Disease Epidemiology</h2>

<p align=justify>
Because infectious diseases often transmit directly or indirectly from person to person, social networks are a powerful tool to understand infectious disease spread.
A branch of my work therefore focuses on using networks and EMR data to understand infectious disease spread. This began with a simple question: can we predcit infection
solely based on being around others suspected of infection? It turns out the answer is: yes! I am now in the process of studying asymptomatic infections, how they affect
disease dynamics in a healthcare setting, and how identifying and quarantining them might lead to smaller outbreaks. I have also done simulation work on infectious
disease questions when the necessary data are not easily obtainable, which has led to important insights in the absence of empirical data.
