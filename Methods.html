<h2>Methodological Work</h2>

<p align=justify>
As Big Data become more ubiquitous, it is imperative that we have methods that sufficiently address the complexities and issues often found with such large data.
To this end, I have developed a number of methods which can analyze salient features of large databases. Although I have applied them exclusively to health-related
situations, I design them to be general enough as to apply to a wide variety of contexts, improving their potential uptake.
