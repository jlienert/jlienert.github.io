<h2>Social network analysis based on EHR and survey data</h2>

<p align=justify>
As humans are social creatures, the way in which we connect to one another is important, especially to our health. This is even true in the hospital, a setting we
often think of as individualistic, as our response to medicine is based mostly on our doctor and our treatment. However, I have shown that this is not always
the case. Most notably, I showed that in the chemotherapy ward, being around <<i>anyone</i> for a significant amount of time is associated
with better outcomes. This type of finding would be difficult without using EMR data, as the surveys or ethnographic observation required would be immense. Moving forward,
I intend to study these kinds of phenomena in other settings (such as the dialysis ward), and study these effects prospecitively, ideally in a randomized clinical trial.
