<h2>Understanding mechanisms of behavioral interventions</h2>

<p align=justify>
The preeminent tool of clinical research, the randomized clinical trial (RCT), is an important paradigm of research that has led to many important findings.
The main outcome of an RCT if often the average treatment effect (ATE), which is the effect the trial would have, on average, if it were implemented in a
population that is similar to the one in which it was studied.
However, as research funds become scarcer, it is important to maximize the effects of trials not just on average, but to individuals. To this end, I have
conducted research to examine <i>who</i> most benefits from a given intervention, and <i>why</i> they benefit.
