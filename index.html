<h2> About Me </h2>

<p> I am an <a href="https://www.cherp.research.va.gov/research/CHERP_Health_Services_Research_Fellowship.asp">advanced fellow in health services research</a>, working with the
  <a href="https://nudgeunit.upenn.edu/">Nudge Unit</a> at the University of Pennsylvania and the Center for Health Equity Research and Promotion
  <a href="https://www.cherp.research.va.gov/">(CHERP)</a> at the Philadelphia VA Medical center. I completed my doctoral work in the
  <a href="https://oxcam.gpp.nih.gov/current_students/profiles_2014.asp">NIH Oxford Cambridge Scholars Program</a>, where I was advised by
  <a href="https://www.genome.gov/14514804/koehly-group/">Dr. Laura Koehly</a> at the Social and Behavioral Research Branch (SBRB) of the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI),
  <a href="https://www.sbs.ox.ac.uk/community/people/felix-reed-tsochas">Prof. Felix Reed-Tsochas</a> at the Said Business School at Oxford University, and
  <a href="http://www.chrismarcum.com/index.php">Dr. Chris Marcum</a>, also at the SBRB. You can view my dissertation <a href="https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:e19e3a20-f154-4a67-bc3c-2e82bee9c845">here</a>.
</p>

<p> My research is currently multi-streamed, with ongoing effort involved in social network analysis, electronic medical records, behavioral phenotyping, and health equity. In my dissertation I
  focused on the intersection of the first two, exmainining how patients co-located in hospital wards (co-presence) impacted health outcomes. My current work at the VA and the University of
  Pennsylvania extends this work to include randomized clinical trials, where I will be implementing social network interventions to ameliorate some health outcomes affected by one's social
  network. I am also in the process of incorportating health equity concerns into my research, as the US population is much more heterogeneous than the British population I focused on in my
  dissertation. This also includes work with <a href="https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/arts/schoolforcross-facultystudies/gsd/aboutus/peoplenew/marcohaenssgen/">Dr. Marco Haenssgen</a>
  and colleagues examining the effect of social networks and precarity on antibitioc usage in low and middle income countries.
</p>

<p> My work on social networks analysis includes both methodological and empirical contributions. Methodologically, I developed an
  <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3119068">algorithm</a>, extending the triad census to include nodal attributes, or colors. This algorithm reduced the
  computational time necessary to calculate this by orders of magnitude over the naive approach. The empirical work includes a recent
  <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/network-science/article/social-influence-on-5year-survival-in-a-longitudinal-chemotherapy-ward-copresence-network/4E08D5F5A0D332AA5BB119310833A244">paper</a>
  in <i>Network Science</i> on the social influence between patients in a chemotherapy ward. Importantly, this work used large observational datasets to answer research questions typically requiring
  detailed ethnographic or survey research for a fraction of the cost. The empirical work also examines how co-presence networks constructed from electronic medical records can be used to
  predict nosocomial infection <a href="https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:e19e3a20-f154-4a67-bc3c-2e82bee9c845">(Chapter 3)</a>.
</p>

<p> I have recently begun incorporating behavioral phenotyping into my work as a way to identify subsets of patients most at-risk of certain outcomes, or who would benefit most from certain interventions.
  As part of the former, I used co-presence networks built from electronic medical records along with biomarker data to infer a class of patients with nosocomial infection below the threshold of
  micorbiological tests. These inferred infections are "subclinical infections" <a href="https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:e19e3a20-f154-4a67-bc3c-2e82bee9c845">(Chapter 4)</a>, and may have many
  adverse effects on both individuals and the disease dynamics of nosocomial infection spread. I am also working on a project analyzing the results of the
  <a href="https://europepmc.org/abstract/med/30003481">Lose It trial</a> to examine latent groups in the participants, and determine if they responded differentially to the trial. Future work
  will include using this type of latent class analysis to optimally allocate participants to different arms of a trial.
